Cluster of Load balance enhances availability and avoid Single Point of Failures
Splitting components in different servers allows for scalability as each server can be independently updated. Due to diagramming limits I didn't add more copies of each but one can do so. 

I added additional webserver to allow load balancing on server requests. Application and MYSQL app servers can also be deplicated and redunantly managed differently.
